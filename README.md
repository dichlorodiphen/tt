# tt

`tt` is a quick and dirty command-line utility for sending tasks to TickTick. Seriously. That's all it does. For when you're too lazy to open up a web browser or tab out of your terminal.

Maybe one day I'll decide I need more than just that and I'll come back and make this not shit.

# Usage

```
tt <task title> 
```

`go build` for the binary.

To set up, create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with the `ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your access token.

Follow TickTick's API guide to obtain an access token. It's a pain in the ass.
